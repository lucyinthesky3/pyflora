Smart Flower Pots

This project features smart flower pots designed to help automate plant care. Using Python and various sensors, the pots monitor soil moisture, temperature, and light levels to ensure optimal growing conditions for plants. The system can send alerts or notifications when the plants need attention, such as watering or repositioning for better sunlight exposure.
